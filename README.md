# ADPCM-and-MP3-compression
This is a course project for Multimedia Data Compression and Coding. We record a 3â€“4 minute audio, analyze its spectrum, compress it using ADPCM and MP3, compare the quality using PSNR, and mix it with a MIDI track to create a jazz-style remix. The project includes all source code, results, and a detailed report.
