# 🎵 Audio Compression Assignment - ADPCM & MP3

## 🎧 Introduction

This is a course project for *Multimedia Data Compression and Coding*.  
We recorded a 3–4 minute audio, analyzed its spectrum using MATLAB, compressed it using **ADPCM** and **MP3**, compared the quality using **PSNR**, and blended it with a MIDI track to create a jazz-style remix.  
The project includes all source code, processed audio files, visualizations, and a detailed report.

## 🚀 Features

- Audio recording with speaker info (name, student ID, task)
- Spectrum analysis using MATLAB
- Audio compression with ADPCM (custom) and MP3 (LAME encoder)
- PSNR comparison: original vs ADPCM, original vs MP3
- MIDI music generation and jazz remix
- Full technical report and group contributions

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- `MATLAB`: Signal spectrum analysis & PSNR computation  
- `Python`: Audio processing (optional for ADPCM)  
- `C`: MP3 compression using LAME library  
- `FFmpeg`: For format conversion and playback testing  
- `GitHub`: Version control and collaboration  
- `Markdown`: Documentation & reporting

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Install dependencies (LAME, MATLAB toolboxes, FFmpeg).
2. Compile and run the MP3 compression using provided C code.
3. Run MATLAB scripts to analyze spectrum and compute PSNR.
4. Open and play files in `audio/` and `midi/` for review.
